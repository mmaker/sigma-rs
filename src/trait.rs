//! Sigma Protocol Trait

/// A trait defining the behavior of a generic Sigma protocol.
///
/// A Sigma protocol is a 3-message proof protocol where a prover can convince
/// a verifier of knowledge of a witness for a given public statement
/// without revealing the witness.
///
/// ## Associated Types
/// - `Commitment`: The prover's initial commitment.
/// - `ProverState`: The prover's internal state needed to compute a response.
/// - `Response`: The prover's response to a verifier's challenge.
/// - `Witness`: The prover's secret knowledge.
/// - `Challenge`: The verifier's challenge value.
///
/// ## Minimal Implementation
/// Types implementing [`SigmaProtocol`] must define:
/// - `prover_commit`
/// - `prover_response`
/// - `verifier`
