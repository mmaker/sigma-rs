//! # Error: Error Types for Zero-Knowledge Proofs
//!
//! This module defines the [`Error`] enum, which encapsulates possible errors that may occur
//! during the execution of Sigma protocols or their non-interactive variants.
//!
//! These errors include:
//! - Verification failures (e.g., when a proof does not verify correctly).
//! - Mismatched parameters during batch verification.
//! - Unimplemented methods.
//! - Group element or scalar serialization failures.
